      "instructions": "To make mole sauce, soak chipotle peppers in hot water until soft. Remove seeds and stem.\nPuree chipotles, roasted peppers, tomatoes and garlic until smooth and set aside.\nToast oregano, cinnamon, sesame seeds and pepper until fragrant.\nIn a saucepan, heat canola oil, then add pureed vegetables, spices, chocolate, salt and tomato sauce. Heat until chocolate melts and then continue to simmer, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. If sauce is too thick, add water to thin as needed.\nHeat oil in a large skillet.\nSeason lamb on all sides liberally with salt and pepper, then sear in skillet until a brown crust forms on all sides.\nLay browned lamb in a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil and pour mole sauce over. Seal tightly so that no air escapes and the sauce wont leak out. (Double foil is a good idea.)\nBake at 325 degrees F for 3-4 hours, until lamb is tender and falls from the bone.",

Whisk in cream, liqueur, and vanilla.

You can also substitute any liqueur for the chocolate liqueur.",

Let the chicken warm up for 30 minutes before cooking.\n3. Heat half of the oil in the pan to medium high heat and brown the sausage rounds, then reserve.\n4. Add the remaining oil and chicken and brown on all sides, then reserve.\n5. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and parsley to start the sofrito. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes then add the crushed and drained tomatoes and cook for about 3 minutes while flavors meld. This base sauce is the sofrito.\n6. Add the rice and stir to mix thoroughly to coat all the rice; about 2 more minutes.\n7. Add back the sausage and chicken. Pour in the hot water, bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to mix and place the pieces.\n8. Place the clams where you want them in the finished dish and don't stir anymore. Cook for 5 minutes.\n9. Place the shrimp tails up where you want them to appear in the finished dish.\n10. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the clams are open, the shrimp are pink and the rice is fluffy and moist but not dry.\n11. With a fork, feel the bottom of the dish. If it has formed a slight crust, called socarrat, it's ready to be served. If the socarrat has not formed, turn the heat up for 30 to 45 seconds while the crust forms. Then serve immediately.",

      "instructions": "Bring a medium pot up to boil. In the meantime, in a medium skillet on medium-low heat, slowly render down the pancetta for 4-5 minutes, trying not to brown it and not crispy. If it starts to brown remove the pan from the heat or lower the flame.\nNext add garlic & onion, saut for 5-6 minutes.\n(Vegetarian Note: Just omit the the pancetta & saut the onions & garlic in olive oil.)\nWhen the onions & garlic are about 2 minutes from being ready, add the tomatoes.\nAt the same time toss the peas in the water and blanch for 2-3 minutes. You want them approximately half-cooked. Strain the peas and throw them directly into the pan with the pancetta adding a spoonful of the pea-water. Allow to cook until peas are cooked but still have a bite.\nTaste and adjust the seasoning with salt & pepper.\nJust before you serve, toss in the herbs and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil.",

Mix in the eggs, one at time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the lemon zest, nutmeg and the vanilla extract. Add one-third of the flour mixture to the batter and mix well. Add one-half of the buttermilk into the batter and mix well. Continue to alternate the flour mixture and the buttermilk. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Optional: Garnish with chopped pecans/walnuts or sliced almonds.\nBake in a preheated oven for 70 to 90 minutes. Do not open oven door within the first hour of baking. The cake is done when it starts to pull away from the tube pans side, or use the toothpick trick. Insert a toothpick and when it comes out clean, the cake is done cooking. After removing the cake from the oven, cool in a pan for 10 minutes. Remove from the cake from the pan and place on a wire rack. Let cool completely.",

Set aside to marinate for a couple of hours.</li><li>Slice the top of the tomatoes off.</li><li>Using a small spoon, scoop out the soft insides of the tomatoes. This reduces the moisture in the dish and prevents sogginess.</li><li>Chop the tomatoes up into small bits.</li><li>Chop the onions into small bits.</li><li>Place the onions and tomatoes in a large bowl.</li><li>Chop up a bunch of cilantro. Use as much or as little as you like.</li><li>Add the cilantro to the onions-tomatoes mixture. Toss together and set aside.</li><li>Cut a slit round an avocado, against its seed.</li><li>Holding each side of the cut avocado, twist the avocado open to reveal the seed.</li><li>Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh. Place the avocado flesh in a large bowl and mash it up evenly till it becomes creamy.</li><li>Add the tomatoes mixture to the avocados.</li><li>Combine well.</li><li>Squeeze in juice from one lemon.</li><li>Add a generous portion of salt to taste. About 1 to 2 teaspoons.</li><li>At this point, youll have guacamole. If you like, dish it up in a serving bowl and serve it with chips.</li><li>Now cook the chicken. Heat a pan with a few tablespoons of cooking oil till its very hot. It has to be very hot or the chicken wont brown.</li><li>Add the chicken to the pan. Be careful! Itll sizzle and splatter.</li><li>Turn the pieces over to brown the other side after a few minutes.</li><li>When the chicken are browned, remove them from the pan and set aside at a warm place.</li><li>Using a clean, dry pan, toast the tortillas one at a time on each side.</li><li>They are ready to be used when they are soft and warm.</li><li>Add a serving of the guacamole mixture.</li><li>Add a serving of the chicken.</li><li>Quickly wrap the burrito up. If it cools, the tortilla will crack and it would be impossible to roll it up.</li><li>Roll over once. Fold in the sides, and roll over again till its fully wrapped.</li><li>Serve immediately or wrap in aluminum foil and keep them in the oven till ready to eat.</li></ol>",

Turn the slices over again, keeping them in a single layer. Bake them for about 10-15 minutes, or until the underside is very nicely browned.</li><li>Flip the slices over with a spatula and bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until the eggplant is very tender and looks caramelized (gooey and well browned) on both sides. Serve immediately.</li><li>You will have some sauce that doesnt quite absorb into the eggplant. It will bake onto the pan, but if you soak the pan for at least 10 minutes, it will wash off easily.</li></ol>",

Juices will eventually come out from the vegetables so no need to add water. Cover, stirring occasionally. Simmer until pork is tender or until the liquid has almost dried up leaving a thick sauce.</li><li>Add the liver, cover for about 5 minutes. I'm adding the liver at a later part because we don't want to overcook it. Liver cooks fast and it can be tough if overdone.</li><li>Add the potatoes, carrots, green peas and raisins (and the rest of the ingredients, if any). Simmer for 15 more minutes stirring occasionally.</li><li>Serve with steamed rice.</li></ol>",

Add to the bowl the fresh parsley, Chobani and almond milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture.\nIn batches, puree the soup in a food-processor (maybe someday soon, a Vitamix!) style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes. Remove the bay leaf before serving or storing.",

In a small bowl, mix together  cup lime juice, honey, red pepper flakes and salt. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving, to blend flavors.</li><li>To Make Chicken: In a shallow bowl add the chicken, 3 tablespoons lime juice and sprinkle with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Coat a large nonstick pan or a grill pan with olive oil spray, add olive oil and heat.  Add chicken, cover, and saut over medium heat until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes total.  Remove the chicken from the pan</li><li>To Make Honey Lime Glaze: In a small bowl, mix together  cup lime juice, 2 tablespoons honey and Tabasco.  Add the honey lime glaze to the same pan.  Cook for about 30 seconds until melted.  Return cooked chicken to pan, flipping the chicken once to coat with the glaze.</li><li>Remove from pan and plate each piece.  Spoon watermelon salsa on top of each piece of chicken and serve with more salsa on the side.</li><li>Serve with our recipe for Simple Garlic Toast, if desired.  Recipe follows.</li><li>Recipe for Simple Garlic Toast</li><li>Start with 4 slices sourdough wheat bread. We bought ours at Trader Joes but most markets sell sourdough wheat bread or use regular sourdough slices.  Cut each slice in half and toast all of them.

As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\nNow you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil. Cut the eggs in half or quarters and serve while hot.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.</li><li>Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.</li><li>Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.</li><li>Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.</li><li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.</li><li>Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.</li><li>Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.</li><li>Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.</li><li>When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.</li><li>Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.</li><li>Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.</li><li>Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.</li><li>Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>Now make the sauce.</li><li>Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.</li><li>When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.</li><li>Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.</li><li>After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.</li><li>The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.</li><li>Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.</li><li>Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.</li></ol>",

Turn of the oven, then leave the cheesecake in the oven,placing  a large wooden spoon in the oven door, so that it remains slightly open. Allow the cheeecake to cool in the open oven for about an hour, then cool completley on a rack. When it's cool, wrap it very well, and cool in the refrigerator for several hours.</li><li>To unmold the cake, wipe the sides and bottom of the pan with a hot, damp towel. Run a thin metal spatula around the edge of the pan. Release the spring, then lift the cake still on the on the removable bottom from the sides of the pan. Flip the cake gently onto a cardboard round or flat platter, remove the bottom, then flip it over onto another cardboard round or flat serving platter.</li></ol>",

Roll dough to a 1/2 inch thickness; cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter\nPlace cut dough on a baking sheet. Use a watermelon scoop or small round spoon to press in a middle of each cut though to make a half hole for raspberry jam\nMix together jam and the remaining vanilla extract.\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of jam into a hole. Don't over put it otherwise it will run all over a scone.\nBake for 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheet; transfer to a wire rack\nWhile they're cooling, combine powdered sugar and milk. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze evenly over scones.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>To make the frosting:</li><li>In a medium-size pan, heat the cream and sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.</li><li>Add the chocolate  & espresso powder and stir until it is thoroughly melted. Remove from the heat, cover, and let cool for about 10 minutes or at least to room temperature.</li><li>Using a mixer, mix the butter on medium-high speed until it is smooth and creamy.</li><li>Turn the mixer to medium-low and add half of the chocolate mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Add the remaining chocolate mixture and mix until smooth and creamy. Set aside until it hardens slightly, to become a spreadable consistency, 1 to 2 hours. (Or, you can refrigerate the frosting for about 30 minutes, or until it becomes thickened and spreadable. Bring it to room temperature before frosting.)</li><li>To make the cake:</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350*</li><li>Generously grease three 9-inch round cake pans. Cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the bottom of each pan and place inside the pans. Grease the waxed paper, and dust the pans with cocoa powder until well coated. Set aside.</li><li>In a small heatproof bowl, pour the boiling water over the 1/2 cup cocoa. Stir until the mixture is very smooth, and set aside to cool.</li><li>Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from the heat.</li><li>Into a medium-size bowl, sift together both flours, the baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li><li>In a bowl, beat the butter until smooth and creamy, (about 5 minutes). Add 2 1/4 cups of the sugar and beat until well blended, (about 5 minutes). Beat in the whole egg and egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the cooled cocoa mixture until very smooth, scraping down the sides as you go. Turn the mixer to medium-low and add the melted chocolate, beating until well incorporated. Add the vanilla.</li><li>Turn the mixer to low and add half the dry ingredients. Then add the quark, mix well, and add the rest of the dry ingredients. Beat until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><li>In a bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites at high speed. When frothy, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the egg whites form stiff peaks, 5 to 6 minutes.</li><li>Using a large rubber spatula, fold about 1 cup of the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Then gently fold that mixture back into the chocolate mixture, just until the egg whites are well incorporated. Do not overmix.</li><li>Distribute the batter evenly among the pans, and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Do not overbake.</li><li>Cakes are done when the tops are just beginning to crack and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs clinging to it. Let cool on a rack for about 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li><li>To assemble:</li><li>Place the first layer on a serving plate and frost the top only. Place the second layer on top of the first and frost the top. Repeat with the top layer. Spread the remaining frosting along the sides until the cake is completely covered with frosting.</li></ol>",

Now transfer the bird to a cutting board. Remove the rack from the pan and spoon off the fat. Set the pan over high heat. Add the stock and cook, scraping up any browned bits and leftover pieces of goodies. Squeeze the last lemon to release the juices. Carve the chicken and pass the chunky jus at the table.",

While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.</li><li>Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. (I started off with loonie sized chunks of dough which was too big. Its more like the size of a quarter. Remember, youre aiming for 50 to 60 of these individual wafers!) With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.</li><li>To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.</li><li>To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. (I dont think its entirely necessary to use a pastry bag. You could just spoon some icing on and squeeze between two wafers.) Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream.</li></ol>",

Slice the tofu very thin, about 1/2 inch per slice, then rub each slice with the spice mixture.  Set aside.\nHeat about 1 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat in a large pan.  Add the tofu, a few slices at a time, watching carefully.  Flip after about 1-2 minutes.  Cook until done  I let mine cook about 2-3 minutes per side.   Half each piece, wrap with bacon, then set aside and cover with aluminum foil.\nDo NOT wash the pan out  now put it back on the stove, reduce heat to medium and add the remaining minced garlic clove, 1 tbsp olive oil and diced jalapeno.  Saute until the peppers are almost getting a little bit brown and everything is fragrant.   Add the cream cheese, 1/2 cup cheese and chicken broth.  Whisk and bring to a slight boil; reducing the heat if you have to, preventing it from scorching. Once its combined and a sauce consistency, salt and pepper to your taste and pour into a separate bowl; cover.\nBring the heat back up to medium-high, and add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  When hot add one tortilla at a time, turning after about 15-20 seconds to the other side.  Your end result will be tortillas slightly brown around the edges and a little bubbly in the middle.\nSet aside and cover.\nTo serve, stuff a tortilla with bacon-wrapped tofu, and drizzle the jalapeno creme on top and some Monterey jack.",

Pound them to a powder (not very fine).\nIn a mortar and pestle grind the green chillies to a paste. (Using a pinch of coarse salt will help)\nMix all the ingredients together and your marinade is ready.\nEnsure that you pat dry the chicken cubes.\nTransfer the chicken in a bowl\nAdd the marinade to the chicken cubes and mix it well so that all pieces are well coated.\nCover the bowl with a cling film and put it in the refrigerator.\nLeave the chicken to marinate over-night. (I marinated for almost 18 hours and the result was moist and tender chicken tikkas)\nFor Grilling:\nI grilled these tikkas in my non-stick grill pan. Using a non-stick pan helped me keep the amount of oil to minimal.\nSoak the skewers in water for at least half an hour before you intend to serve them.\nNow take the skewers and start skewering the chicken pieces on them. I leave a little space in between the chicken pieces; else they stick together and do not get cooked well. (Perhaps the reason could be pan grilling)\nKeep the skewers ready and then heat the pan (medium hot).\nYou can use an oil spray or pour a little oil using a spoon in a linear fashion across the grill pan.\nPlace the skewers over the oiled pan and grill them on medium low heat.\nIt will take approximately 45 seconds to a minute for one side to get cooked.\nThen turn around and cook the other side the same way.\nServe them hot as a starter or as a main course with Bakarkhani!!

Add curry leaves- BE CAREFUL, they pop hot oil! Add onions and peppers- sweat for about 30 seconds. Add chopped garlic, chilies and turmeric. Saute for about 5-7 minutes, until the onions and peppers are soft. Add peas and carrots mixture, cumin powder and salt. Saute for about 7-10 minutes- you want all the veggies to be soft and cooked through.\nMeanwhile in a small bowl, add the cubed tofu, a pinch of turmeric, cumin powder, coarse black pepper and some cayenne pepper (totally optional!). Mix and set aside to marinate for a bit.\nOnce the veggies are cooked, add the tofu- saute until slightly brown and soft enough that it crumbles. Add juice form half a lemon and half of the chopped cilantro. Mix and add the diced boiled potato, and toss until everything is coated, soft and taste for salt/spices. Using a masher, mash the mixture until mushy and until the veggies are small. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, add a bit of the breadcrumbs and mix with your hands. Start forming into thick patties (mixture should make 4). If its still giving you a hard time, add more breadcrumbs. Make 4 patties, place on a plate and wrap with plastic wrap until ready to use.\nIn a small skillet sprayed with PAM over medium-high heat, add one patty at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side- until browned and crispy.At the same time, saute the thick slices of onion, until charred and slightly soft. Spread a generous amount of the chutney spread on each side on the bread, place burger, onions tomato and cilantro leaves. Serve with a slice of lemon and reduced-fat chips on the side.",

Add them into your food processor and pulse until all ingredients are well mixed together.\nHeat oil in a large skillet. Add the mixture above, diced onions, chopped dill and parsley, soy granules, eggs (or egg substitute) and spices. Saut for 10 minutes.\n* I added the soy granules without boiling them because the mushrooms contain a lot of water and these soy granules will absorb all excess water.\nPut some parchment paper on the bottom of a casserole. Divide the mashed potatoes in two. Place the first half in the casserole and spread it with a spatula. Add the filling. Place over the other half of mashed potatoes.\nHeat your oven at 392. Put the casserole in the oven. Cook for 40 minutes.\nDon't serve immediately. Let it cool for at least half an hour.",

You can do this part with the food processor if you want, but I prefer to just mix by hand because you still have to transfer it all to a bowl, so it's less to clean up.\nAdd the cream, egg, honey, vanilla, and brandy. Knead the dough until it comes together.\nDump the apples in and press them into the dough until they are evenly distributed and you have a nice round ball of dough. As with any bread, handle it as little and as quickly as possible or the scones will be tough.\nOn a floured surface flatten the dough ball into a one inch thick disc. Use just enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands as this will dry out the dough.\nCut the disc into 8 equal sections.\nPlace scones on the baking sheet and sprinkle with Turbonado sugar.\nBake for approximately 15 - 18 minutes or until they are golden brown.\nMelt butter and drizzle over the top of a warm scone. Oh my...scrumptious :)\nTransfer the rest to a wire rack to cool.\nStore in a sealed container or Ziploc bag. They also freeze well for 3 to 4 months.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>Massage mustard sauce into the meat. Wrap the meat tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days. (The sauce was really thin and liquid-y so after dumping about half on the meat and realizing massaging was just not going to happen, I threw the meat and the sauce into a ziplock bag, shook it up and made sure it was coated then threw it in the fridge for the three day marinating marathon.)</li><li>At least one hour prior to cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator and unwrap, placing the meat and the marinating juices into a disposable 913 disposable aluminum pan and let it come to room temperature. (As I mentioned above, my pans were a bit flimsy so I doubled up.) Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.</li><li>Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled halfway with charcoal (about 3 quarts) and allow to burn until the coals are partially covered with a layer of ash. Build a modified two-level fire by arranging all the coals over half of the grill, leaving the other half empty. Open the bottom grill vents completely. Place the wood chips on the coals. Set the cooking grate in place, cover and heat the grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean. Sip a wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding the wad with tongs, oil the cooking grate.</li><li>Set the aluminum pan with the roast on the grate opposite the coals. Open the grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, making sure the vent is above the meat to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about eight briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275F for three hours. (When I added coals, I also basted the marinade over the roast to ensure moistness.)</li><li>Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325F. Wrap the pan holding the roast, being careful not to spill the marinating liquid, with heavy duty aluminum foil to cover completely. Place the pan in the oven and cook until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li><li>Carefully slide the foil-wrapped pan with the roast into a brown paper bag. Crimp the end shut. Let rest for 1 hour. (I found it easiest to lay the paper bag open on its side and slide the roast in, instead of dropping it downward, then folding the opening up and taping it shut.)</li><li>While roast is resting, prepare barbecue sauce. If wanting true South Carolina style barbecue sauce, make the marinade above. If wanting a thicker, tangier sauce with a hot finish, I highly recommend Inas barbecue sauce below. Its a bit of an ingredient dump with 11 of 13 items being from jars and bottles, but with flavors so loud and clamoring for your taste-buds attention, you wont regret it.</li><li>In a large sauce pan on low heat, saute onions and garlic with the oil until the onions are translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 30 minutes. Use immediately or store in fridge. Makes about 6 cups.</li><li>Keeping: This sauce freezes excellently. I made a big batch last fall and froze it, pulling it out for the pulled pork. I re-heated in a sauce pan on low heat until hot.</li><li>Once pork has rested, transfer the roast to a carving board and dispose of the marinade liquid and pan. When cool enough to handle, separate the roast into sections, removing fat if desired, and tear the meat into shreds with your fingers (forks work just as well without your fingers getting messy). Place the shredded meat in a large bowl. Toss with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce, adding more to taste. Serve, passing the remaining sauce separately.</li></ol>",

For the pittata, we didn't use anything, but this is when you would add your cooked vegetables or raw vegetables that don't require much cooking (e.g. bell pepper). Pour in the egg mixture and tilt the skillet to ensure it evenly surrounds any add-ins. Now distribute the shredded cheese and pepperoni slices (if using).</p><p>5. Allow the eggs to cook on the stove until the edges of the eggs are set. The center will still be a bit jiggly. Now is a good time to top with Parmesan cheese (be generous!)</p><p>6. Transfer the pan to the hot oven and bake until the eggs are puffed and browned with a firm center. Remove from oven and let cool for a couple minutes before cutting into wedges.</p>",

Once at a boil, add the citrus peels and stir. Turn the heat down to medium and cook down until most of the water is gone. When it starts to look like jam, its done. Place sauce pan in a freezer to quickly cool down the mixture.\nWhen date jam is cooled, preheat the oven to 400F and begin to prepare the rest of the recipe.\nCombine flour, baking soda, salt and oats in a bowl and whisk together.\nIn another large mixing bowl, beat sugar and butter until creamy.\nAdd the dry ingredients to the butter and cream and mix with a spatula or large wooden spoon until completely mixed. The texture will look quite crumbly.\nCoat  a 13x9-inch metal baking pan with cooking spray. Then begin layering your ingredients carefully.\nA.Layer half of the crumb mixture and press down in the pan to make the bottom layer crust.\nB.CAREFULLY spread your date jam on top of the crumb crust using a spatula sprayed with some oil.\nC.Finally, sprinkle the remainder of the crumb mixture on top of the date jam.\nBake for about 20-30 minutes, until the top is golden.\nCool completely before cutting.",

      "instructions": "Preheat your oven to 375F and set the top rack to the middle position (BTW, this recipe is a great toaster oven candidate).  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or a nonstick cooking mat.\nIn a large bowl, combine the crab meat, diced red bell pepper, half of the diced green onion (reserving the other half) and half of the bread crumbs (reserving the other half).  Mix in the honey and chili powder, then season to taste with salt and pepper.\nI like to form my crab cakes by pressing them into a 1/2 cup measure, squeezing tightly so theyll hold their shape.  You can mould them with your hands as well, but be sure to press them together tightly or they might fall apart in transit to the plates.  Arrange the crab cakes on the lined baking sheet, leaving at least 1 between each crab cake.\nUsing your olive oil sprayer (if you have one; or by drizzling olive oil) lightly coat the outside of each crab cake.  This will help with browning and to form an outer crust.  Bake at 375F for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.\nMeanwhile, fry the bacon or prosciutto in a large skillet until crispy.  Set aside to drain, then crumble into small pieces using a sharp knife.\nFinely chop the spinach and watercress stems.  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saut 1 minute.  Then, add the remaining green onion, bread crumbs and watercress stems.  Saut 1 minute more.  Finally, add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, 1-2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, plate a crab cake atop a smear of the spinach mixture, then sprinkle the whole plate with crumbled bacon.",

      "instructions": "To make the crumb crust\nIn a small bowl combine the graham crumbs, sugar and melted butter.\nPress into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)\nTo prepare the cheesecake\nIn a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.\nCream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nStir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.\nFinally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.\nPour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.\nRemove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)\nAllow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven).\nTo finish the cheesecake\nWhen completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired.\nChill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",

Melt the butter and add the celeryand onion to a medium pot and saute over medium heat for about 8 minutes.Step 2: Stir in 2/3 cup flour, salt and pepper, celery seed, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the the mixture begins to thicken and then simmer lightly until thickened. Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

(You do not have to cook the western style couscous which is pre-steamed and instant.)\nPreheat the oven to 400* F. Grease an ovenproof dish with nonstick spray. Arrange the vegetables, except the asparagus in a single layer in the prepared dish and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for about 20 to 25 minutes until the vegetables are done but still crisp - add the asparagus after the first 10 minutes of roasting and stir the vegetables slightly. When the vegetables are done sprinkle with a little balsamic vinegar.\nWhen the couscous are done stir in the extra-virgin olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, and pesto to make the couscous moist and fragrant. Add the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.\nAdd the roasted vegetables to the couscous and mix with the couscous. Add the feta cheese and mix with the roasted vegetables and couscous. This salad can be served warm or cooled down to room temperature and it is delicious served with beef or chicken.",

Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.\nNOTES\nCocoa powder is extremely bitter, so make sure you like the taste before rolling all of them in cocoa powder. My personal favorites are the shredded coconut or dark chocolate! :)",

Pat the dough into a disk. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 16- to 17-inch round about 1/4 inch thick. \nLine a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll it onto the prepared baking sheet. \n In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the sugar with the remaining 1 tablespoon of flour and sprinkle over the dough. Arrange the apple slices on top in overlapping concentric circles to within 3 inches of the edge. Fold the dough over the apples in a free-form fashion. Brush the apples with the melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and cinnamon. Refrigerate the unbaked tart until slightly chilled, about 10 minutes. \nPreheat the oven to 400. Bake the tart in the center of the oven for 1 hour, or until the apples are tender and golden and the crust is deep golden and cooked through. Brush the apples with the melted preserves. Slide the parchment onto a wire rack and let the tart cool slightly before serving.",

Spread the marinade so that it covers all the chicken.\n4. Marinade overnight.\n5. Take the chicken out of the fridge about 30-45 minutes before you roast it, so it comes closer to room temperature. This helps the chicken become more moist and cooked evenly.\n6. Preheat the oven to 450F.\n7. Remove the chicken from the marinate and brush off any garlic so it will not burn.\n8. Lay the chicken breast side up in a roasting pan or cast iron skillet.\n9. Truss the chicken. This keeps the juices in during the roasting and makes the meat more tender.\n10. Roast 45-55 minutes.\n11. Let rest 5 minutes before carving.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>Preheat an oven to 350</li><li>Stud the rinsed and peeled rack of corned beef ribs with the three cloves, fairly evenly spaced along the top meaty side of the ribs.</li><li>Place the ribs in a large, deep covered roasting pan or Dutch oven.</li><li>Sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the ribs along with the slices of garlic and the bay leaves.</li><li>Add enough water to just cover the ribs - this will vary depending on the size of your pan.</li><li>Put the pan, covered, into the oven and cook for one hour.</li><li>While the ribs are braising for the first hour, prepare the vegetables.</li><li>After the first hour, add all the vegetables, except for the cabbage, into the pan. Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.</li><li>After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.</li><li>During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze.</li><li>Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.</li><li>Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li><li>Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.</li><li>Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising.</li><li>Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours).</li><li>Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs.</li><li>Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze.</li><li>Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425</li><li>Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.</li><li>When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!).</li><li>Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own.</li></ol>",
